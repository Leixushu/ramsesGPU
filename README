- Quickstart for building RAMSES-GPU using autotools

 0. make sure to have up-to-date autotools on you build system (autoconf, automake, libtool, m4); then run `sh autogen.sh`
 1. configure --with-cuda=<path to CUDA toolkit root directory> 
 2. make (or make -j N to speed-up compilation time; you might need to execute make several times when using option -j)

Note: make sure to have CUDA toolkit installed, and environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly set.

This will build the monoCPU / monoGPU version of the programme to solve hydro/MHD problems. Executable are located in src subdirectory and named euler_cpu / euler_gpu

Execute a test run:
	
	cd src
	./euler_gpu --param ../data/jet2d_gpu.ini

This will start a Hydrodynamics 2D jet simulation run. Output files can be
in multiple file format (VTK, Hdf5, ...).

To visualize Hdf5 output, just run:

   	paraview --data=./jet2d_gpu.xmf
